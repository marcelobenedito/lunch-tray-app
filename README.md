Lunch Tray App
==================================

The Lunch Tray app is an interactive lunch ordering app with three screens. Each screen represents one of the three types of menu items from which you can select: an entree, a side dish, and an accompaniment.
It's developed using Jetpack Compose components like ```Column```, ```Button```, ```Text```, ```Image```, and ```Modifier```.
